1. SQL (structured query language) is a standard language for database creation and manipulation. MySQL is a relational
database program that uses SQL queries. Relational databases are databases that use a structure that allows us to 
identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database called relationships.
2. Normalization organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly 
execute their dependencies. It avoids duplication by using relationships.
3. Primary keys are the field(s) used to uniquely identify each record in a table. Its 3 requirements are that it: 
cannot be null, must be unique, and there can only be one defined per table. A foreign key is a field(s) in a table
that references the primary key of another table. The data in the fields for both tables is the same and the primary
table must have existing records before the foreign table can have the matching or related records. 
4. The 3 relationship types are:
One-to-one: for every record in the primary table there is only one related record in the foreign table
One-to-many: for every record in the primary table there are one or more related records in the foreign table
Many-to-many: for every record in the primary table there are one or more related records in the foreign table, and 
for every record in the foreign table there are one or more related records in the primary table
5. Left join returns all the records from the left table (table 1), while inner join returns records that have 
matching values in both tables
