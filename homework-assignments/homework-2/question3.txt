3. Similarities: Both flex box and CSS grid are web layout systems that separate content into containers 
in order to format the structure of the overall webpage. Both flex box and CSS grid can use rows and columns to format containers, although
how they do can do this is different for both.
Differences: Flex box is a 1d layout system while CSS grid is 2d. Flex box, being 1d, can only format the child containers of the parent containers
in either columns or rows but not both. On the other hand, CSS grid can form both columns and grids that would allow the layout to look "grid-like".
