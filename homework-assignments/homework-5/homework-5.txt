1. HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a client server protocol that fetches resources like HTML documents or JSON data and
handles communication between clients and servers through requests and responses. The HTTP methods are: 
GET: retrieves data
POST: sends data to the server, which typically creates a new resource
PUT: updates everything (all current representations) for a resource 
PATCH: partially updates a resource
DELETE: deletes a resource
2. An API (application programming interface) is a way to allow two or more computer programs or componenets to communicate. 
JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects 
consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays.
3. AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows for exchanging data with webservers
to happen in the background asynchronously so that the webpage can be updated without reloading the entire thing. Asynchronous code allows for
code to run in the background while other code can still execute.
4. REST is an architectural style of organizing our code so that requests act upon resources in a standardized way. Resources are any 
information that can be named (like a document or image) and might be the target of an author’s hypertext reference. It is a mapping
to a set of entities. If my application had a concept called posts and
was designed in a RESTful way, what would the URI and HTTP request method be to:
a. retrieve multiple posts: GET /posts
b. retrieve a single post: GET /posts/id
c. save a post: POST /posts
d. update a post: POST /posts/id
5. Hoisting is the concept that everytime a new execution context is entered, variables and functions are created and pushed to the top
of their scope before they are executed. Closure is the ability of a function to remember the variables and functions
that are declared in its outer scope.
