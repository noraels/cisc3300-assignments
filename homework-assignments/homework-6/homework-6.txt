1. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server side scripting and interpreted programming language that is dynamic and weakly typed.
Server side languages process user input and interact with other servers.
2. Similarities: They are both dynamic and weakly typed and both make dynamic content for a webpage. 
Differences: javascript is traditionally client side meaning it executes in the browser doing things like changing the content of
the webpage while php is server side meaning it executes on the server and handles data before it goes to the browser dealing with 
things like form submissions and databases. Javascript can do real time updates to the HTML of a page but PHP generates the HTML before
it gets sent to the browser. 
3. PHP is easy to learn due to its simple syntax and can sync very quickly to most databases and web servers. It is also very 
widely used (used on 79.2% of all websites).
4. The include and require keywords take all the text/code/markup that exists in a specified file and copy it into the file that is 
uses the keyword. The difference is that if the file is not found, with the include keyword an error will be given and the script will 
continue executing, but with the require keyword it will stop completely. If you use a variable from a file that hasn't been included yet
you will get an error saying undefined variable because the PHP has not loaded the content of that file, which includes its variables.
5. echo command is a way to output text while var_dump dumps information about one or more variables including the type and value 
(including non-primitive values) of the variable.
